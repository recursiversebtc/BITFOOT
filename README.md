<h1>Recursive BITFOOT</h2>
Recursive BITFOOT is one of the first 10k Recursive ordinals collections. 
The original BITFOOT are being recreated by combining different pre-inscribed traits. 
Mint is 100% free. Find the BITFOOT you want in the SVG folder and inscribe the SVG file to claim it.

<h2>How to check if a Recursive BITFOOT is already inscribed?</h2>
<p><i>First = First. To check of you had the first one check the <a href="https://bitpunks.io/Explorer/Inscriptions">BitPunks explorer</a> (bottom left).</i></p>

<h2>How do these ‘recursive inscriptions’ work?</h2>
<p>All BITFOOT traits have been inscribed in ordinals (view them <a href="https://ordiscan.com/address/bc1qy2495ajaj3exycxfwz4fhug5whfzs5np4xdvr4" target="_blank">here</a>).<br> 

These traits are being combined into a new inscription to regenerate the original BITFOOT into an SVG file.</p>
